<p>
	<strong>The Last Supper</strong> is a late 15th century mural painting by Italian artist <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> housed by the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The work is presumed to have been started around 1495–96 and was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with his apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John, 13:21. Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Apostles when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.
